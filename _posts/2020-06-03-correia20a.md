title: On Pruning for Score-Based Bayesian Network Structure Learning
abstract: Many algorithms for score-based Bayesian network structure learning (BNSL),
  in particular exact ones, take as input a collection of potentially optimal parent
  sets for each variable in the data. Constructing such collections naively is computationally
  intensive since the number of parent sets grows exponentially with the number of
  variables. Thus, pruning techniques are not only desirable but essential. While
  good pruning rules exist for the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), current results
  for the Bayesian Dirichlet equivalent uniform (BDeu) score reduce the search space
  very modestly, hampering the use of the (often preferred) BDeu. We derive new non-trivial
  theoretical upper bounds for the BDeu score that considerably improve on the state-of-the-art.
  Since the new bounds are mathematically proven to be tighter than previous ones
  and at little extra computational cost, they are a promising addition to BNSL methods.
